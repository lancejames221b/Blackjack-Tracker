- 1-2 are the same image and 3-4 are the same image. 
(I took twice just in case anything fucked up)

- they are all ordered in the same order so that it's easier for you to evaluate the results.



image 1 and 2 is potrait, with the order:

1	2	3	4	5
6	7	8	9	10
-	J	Q	K	-





image 3 and 4 is landscape and messy-ish, with the order:

5	-	K
4	8	Q
3	7	J
2	6	10
1	-	9
