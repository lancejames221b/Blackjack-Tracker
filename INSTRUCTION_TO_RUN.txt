Instructions to run the blackjack tracker			 
By Alvin, Jason and Marty					 
********************************************************************************
# Plug in the external webcam, wait for about 30 seconds for the device to be
# recognized

# Navigate to the top directory of the project
cd "wherever this readme file is, that's the top directory"

# to workon the virtual environment included in this folder
source blackjack_env/bin/activate
# you should now see (blackjack_env) at the front of your command line

# find the location of OpenCV python binary (cv2.so) on your machine
find /usr/local/lib/ -type f -name "cv2*.so"

# You should see something like the following: 
# Note: you need to have OpenCV compiled for Python3
# binary installed in dist-packages (copy the output)
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

# forcefully remove all symbolic link to OpenCV in the current directory to
# avoid conflict. they are likely linked from other (my) machine. 
# if rm indicates no such file present, just move on.
rm -f cv2*.so

# create a symbolic link to OpenCV in your local machine
ln -s "the file location copied above in line 21"

# (Optional) to test if opencv is linked correctly
python
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
# We used OpenCV 3.3.0 but anything after version 3 should work.

# To run the program
python main.py

# To exit from the virtual environment
deactivate

********************************************************************************
Additional Notes:
- It is assumed that the external webcam is plugged in and is the second webcam 
on your machine. If for some reason this is not the case, please manually edit 
line26 in main.py to change the index number of the device.
- Program starts in the calibration stage with 100 seconds countdown 
- Press 'a' if you're happy with the transformation found
- Program enters card recognition state.
- Press 't' to toggle between gesture state and card recognition state.
- Press 'c' to recalibrate and 'a' to accept the calibration
- Press 'q' to quit the program

- There's a little bug for division by zero during runtime but doesn't affect 
performance, so ignore it. (to be fixed)
